# Case-Study 1
# Analysis of Loan data from Lending Club

This data collection comprises thousands of loans made using the Lending Club platform, which allows people to lend money to other people.It is vital to remember the dataset only covers loans that were actually made and should not be confused with loan applications data. By exploring the dataset, it is noticed that not every loan is the same in the sense that there are individuals who appear likely to pay their loan when compared to others by considering loan repayment history. On the other hand someone who appears to be a safe bet to repay a loan will find it easier to obtain a low-interest loan than someone who appears to be riskier. People who take a lot of chances, may not have received a loan offer at all, or they may have rejected it due to a high interest rate.

When a person requests for a loan, the company may make one of two decisions:

#### Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan.

Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed.

Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan

#### Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan because the candidate does not meet their requirements. Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of the applicants with the company and in the dataset as well.

# Objective: 
Objective is to identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
